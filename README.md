# dotfiles_harmonised

## My dotfiles
 * If you are reading this, then I probably wouldn't bother or waste your time. This is just a store for the various configuration files that I use, across the machines that I work on.
 * That being said, if you wish to steal anything, (as I undoubtedly have), then please be my guest!

## Setup
* OS: [xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) 19.10 (xfce)
	* Trouble setting up wireless drivers. See https://askubuntu.com/questions/1218141/dell-vostro-5490-no-wifi-in-ubuntu-18-04
* Window manager: i3wm (+gaps) alongside xfce desktop environment
* zsh + [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
* vim + [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* bash dotfiles for legacy purposes only
