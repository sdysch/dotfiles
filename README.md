```
* Then reboot

#### Annoyances

	* network manager
	* cron
	* bluetooth
	* lightdm/sddm
	* ssh agent
* sddm/lightdm themes need to be installed system- not user-wide
 
### Xubuntu
_Used for years before switching to arch as main, I still maintain legacy configs for now_
* Installation with gnu stow
* For home, clone repo to `~/dotfiles` then:
```
cd ~/dotfiles
source install_scripts/install_xubuntu.sh
cd setups
stow --no-folding xubuntu --target=$HOME
```


### Deprecated setups
These are setups that I no longer use, the tag with these setups still in use is [https://github.com/sdysch/dotfiles/releases/tag/before_removing_legacy_configs](before_removing_legacy_configs)

#### mac
* Installation with gnu stow
```
# Install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
cd ~/dotfiles
cat packages/cask.txt packages/leaves.txt | xargs brew install
stow --no-folding mac
```

#### lxplus
* Clone repo to `~/dotfiles`, then:
```
cd ~/dotfiles
source install_scripts/install_lxplus.sh
```

#### Manchester
* Clone repo to `~/dotfiles`, then:
```
cd ~/dotfiles
source install_scripts/install_manchester.sh
```

For Manchester, to do anything useful with git, be sure to do
```
setupATLAS
lsetup git
```
on a machine with cvmfs available. The default git version that is installed on these machines (1.7.1) is _way_ too old (yes it is completely ridiculous that this is required)
