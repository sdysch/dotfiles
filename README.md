# dotfiles_harmonised

## My dotfiles
 * If you are reading this, then I probably wouldn't bother or waste your time. This is just a store for the various configuration files that I use, across the machines that I work on.
 * That being said, if you wish to steal anything, (as I undoubtedly have), then please be my guest!

## zsh
	* I am (slowly) moving from bash to zsh (using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
	* The bash dotfiles may become obsolete

## Example zsh

![shell](figures/screenshot.png)



## Usage
* Install with source install.sh (Creates a dotfiles and dotfiles_old directory in $HOME)
* Will create symlinks of all dotfiles to $HOME area
